# Visual Studio Code

VSCode users, are you in for a treat?!

This project comes pre-configured with debug profiles for the server, client,
worker and tests in `launch.json`. We also preconfigured VSCode with some
settings that work beautifully for this project, and even recommend some
extensions you may want to use!

To view the
[workspace recommended extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_workspace-recommended-extensions),
select the `Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions` command from your command
palette.
